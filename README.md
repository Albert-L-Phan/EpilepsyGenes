# EpilepsyGenes
## Introduction
In this study, we investigated relationships between genes associated with epilepsy using PubMed. First we used the pubmed.mineR package in R to search for abstracts that were dated from 8th December 2023 and 8th December 2024, and contained both of the terms 'Epilepsy' and 'Gene'. From this, we found 1373 abstracts. The igraph package was then used to visualize the relationships between the genes. Gephi was then used to make the graph interactive.
